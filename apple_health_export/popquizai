Scorpion is the fifth studio album by Canadian rapper Drake. It was released on June 29, 2018, by Cash Money Records, Republic Records, and Young Money Entertainment. Scorpion is a double album consisting of 25 tracks. Its first disc is primarily hip hop, while its second disc has been described as R&B and pop. It was executively produced by Drake himself, alongside frequent collaborator 40 and manager Oliver El-Khatib. Scorpion features guest appearances from Jay-Z and Ty Dolla Sign, as well as posthumous appearances from Michael Jackson and Static Major.

Lyrically, the album sees Drake rap about topics that have been common in his discography, including claustrophobia, relationships, and boasting about his rise from underdog to a prominent figure in music. The production draws influence from a range of genres, including soul, ambience, quiet storm, R&B, pop, electronica, and trap.

Scorpion was supported by the singles "God's Plan", "Nice for What", "I'm Upset", "Don't Matter to Me", "In My Feelings", "Nonstop", and "Mob Ties". All seven singles reached the top twenty on the US Billboard Hot 100, with three of them reaching number one: "God's Plan", "Nice for What", and "In My Feelings". In its first day of release, Scorpion broke Spotify's one-day global record for album streams with 132.45 million streams. It also broke Apple Music's single-day record with 170 million streams, breaking Drake's own record set with More Life.

Scorpion received lukewarm reviews from critics, with praise directed at the quality of its tracks but criticism directed at the album's length as a whole. Despite this, it performed well commercially, debuting atop the US Billboard 200 with 732,000 album-equivalent units, of which 160,000 came from pure sales. As of January 2019, Scorpion was certified five times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The album received five nominations at the 2019 Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year, and "God's Plan" won Best Rap Song. The album also won Drake a second Top Billboard 200 Album of his career at the 2019 Billboard Music Awards, among other awards.

Background
Drake announced the album on Instagram on April 16, 2018, followed by the announcement of its release date on June 14.[3][4] Two days before release, Scorpion was confirmed to be a double album, Drake's first, after a promotional billboard alluded to the format. The double album consists of a rap-oriented side and an R&B-oriented side, the two genres that Drake focuses on.[5]

Prior to the album's release, Drake became engaged in a rivalry with American rapper Pusha T. In May 2018, after Drake released a diss track titled "Duppy Freestyle" in response to Pusha T's album Daytona, Pusha T released "The Story of Adidon" which alleged that Drake had a secret child. Scorpion finally addressed the rumor, and later Drake admitted to having a son named Adonis, with French artist Sophie Brussaux.[6][7] In response to Pusha T's diss track, critics highlighted that the album's title, Scorpion, was a response to Drake's critics.[8]

Release and promotion
On January 19, 2018, Drake released the two-track extended play Scary Hours.[11] It included the singles "Diplomatic Immunity" and "God's Plan", the latter of which served as the lead single to Scorpion after debuting at number one on the US Billboard Hot 100.[12] Following this, Drake released the album's second single "Nice for What" on April 6, which also charted in the same position.[13][14] On May 26, the third single "I'm Upset" was released.[12][15] On July 6, the song "Don't Matter to Me" was sent to British contemporary hit radio as the album's fourth single.[16] On July 10, the song "In My Feelings" was sent to the US rhythmic and contemporary hit radio as the album's fifth single.[17][18] The song later went on to become the third song off the album to reach number one on the US Billboard Hot 100.[19] "Nonstop" was released to rhythmic radio in the US as the album's sixth single on July 31.[20] "Mob Ties" was released to urban contemporary airplay in the US as the album's seventh single on January 6, 2019.[21]

A series of billboards promoting the album surfaced in Toronto, on June 22, while a trailer for the album was released on June 26.[22][23] The album's promotion on the streaming service Spotify attracted some controversy from its subscribers for what they perceived to be excessive promotion, with Drake appearing in most of the service's editorial playlists, including ones which he had nothing to do with, such as those for electronic dance music and even gospel music.[24] Following the release of the album, Drake also embarked on his second co-headlining tour with Migos, Aubrey & the Three Migos Tour, which began on August 12, 2018, in Kansas City.[25]
